Hello Debi,

Hope you are doing well.

I would like to request a release from my current project (DFG Moneymart) as its been nearing 3 years working in it and now I would like to be released from the same and look for opprtunities in other domians.

Furthermore, I was recently moved into the tools team. A decision which I was made aware of at the last moment. It is totally inappropriate that such decision was made without any prior discussions inspite of me being a part of the project for such a long time.

Please grant me a release from the project as I would like to make a switch to another domain.
